Projects Involved
Deepfake video detection using DFT
- I've worked as a freelance in group project which detected whether a video is original or deepfake. It
worked pretty well on high resolution face dominant videos.
Recommendation System for social media
- Created a recommendation system for a social media that recommend similar feeds to users,
recommends whom to follow and gives recommendation about therapist based on age, diagonosis and
location and deployed using flask.
Predicting Handwritten Devanagari Characters using modified-Lenet Model Architecture
 - Published a preprint on ResearchSquare. Link:      https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-
2137648/v1
Computer vision based robotic arm
- A 3d printed robotic arm that implements inverse kinamatics and openCV to detect, localize, pick and
drop red colored circular objects from the workspace based on feed from webcam.
