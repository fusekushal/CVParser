Data Engineer Associate Trainee with a focus on handling data and ETL. Skilled in Python, SQL,
Pandas, Numpy, and AWS. I have practical experience in creating and improving ETL pipelines. I'm
enthusiastic about using technology to make working with data easier and to support data-based
decision-making.
PROJECT EXPERIENCE
Application of Computer Vision in Robotic Arm
●
Developed and implemented a computer vision-controlled robotic arm model for large-scale
industrial applications.
●
Applied data preprocessing techniques, including image conversion to Hue, Saturation, and
Value (HSV) format, Histogram Equalization, Circular Hough Transform (CHT), and Canny
Edge Detection, to optimize object detection processes.
●
Identiﬁed that color processing is ideal in stable lighting conditions, while CHT serves as a
robust alternative in challenging scenarios, showcasing adaptability and data-driven
decision-making in the context of computer vision.
●
Employed linear regression with gathered data to ﬁne-tune constant values, highlighting a
data-driven approach to improve system accuracy and efﬁciency.
●
Published the ﬁndings in the 13th IOE Graduate Conference proceedings. (ISSN: 2350-8914
(Online), 2350-8906 (Print))
